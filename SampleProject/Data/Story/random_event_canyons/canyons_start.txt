The next morning, you pack up and head towards the canyons. Forest abruptly gives way to a steep cliff edge. Red and yellow striations on the opposite cliff face glow in the morning sun.

$COMMENTER.NAME$ points towards the switchbacks worn into the cliff face. "Glad those haven't slid into the canyon yet."

You now have $RESOURCE.WATER$ water, $RESOURCE.FOOD$ food, $RESOURCE.MORALE$ morale, and $RESOURCE.YELLOWSTONE$ yellowstone.
