The next morning, you set back out towards the wastes. Once you've cleared the forest, the horizon stretches on for miles. Occasional chest-high shrubs dot the landscape.

"I've always thought those plants look like a mangled hand" comments $COMMENTER.NAME$. "See how the branches bend back at those wierd angles?"

Night falls and day breaks uneventfully.

You now have $RESOURCE.WATER$ water, $RESOURCE.FOOD$ food, and $RESOURCE.MORALE$ morale.
