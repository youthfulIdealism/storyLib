The fight ends just as quickly as it began. Silently, the beasts turn heel and dissapear into the night. The sounds of crying children and running feet are quiet by comparison. Slowly, defenders turn to help the injured, parents gather children in their arms, and order is restored.

"Thanks", you tell $SEER.NAME$. "We only lost two people. That would have been a lot worse without your help."
