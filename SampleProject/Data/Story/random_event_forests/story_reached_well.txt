As the sun begins to set, the caravan circles the wagons up for protection. Fires are lit in the center, and men retrieve spears and stand looking into the dark outside the circle. Families begin to cook and eat.

You call advisors and heads of household to your fire. It's time to make some decisions.

The well won't stay safe for long--remaining near it for any significant length of time will attract swarms of beasts. You could lose half the caravan in a night. You need to figure out where to roam next.
