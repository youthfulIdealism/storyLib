You stop the caravan and instruct people to stretch tarps between the wagons. Hopefully, you can restock on water using the rain.

Too late, you notice a trickle of muddy water winding its way between your feet. With a roar, the flash flood hits. You're buried in a spinning world of white and brown as you're thrown downstream. You hit a protruding rock, and your breath is knocked out of you--but clutch it with all your strength.

The flood eventually passes.

You gather up the broken remnants of your caravan, and move to higher ground. Many people were lost or killed in the rushing water.
